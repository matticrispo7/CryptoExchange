# Cryptocurrency Exchange

This is a master's degree project whose goal was to implement a cryptocurrency echange as a SPA. 

An extensive use of RxJS's observable was made to manage all the reactive components.


The backend and the fronted were provided as Docker containers.


A documentation describing the system architecture, API and usage is provided.

In order to test the system there are some predefined users with the following credentials. </br> The first one is:
- username: user
- password: user </br>

and the latter is:
- username: tmp
- password: tmp

## Setup
With the command **docker-compose up** is possible to execute the containers.

The exchange can be then reached at: *crispino.soi2122.local:8080/*
